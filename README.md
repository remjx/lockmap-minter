# ðŸ”“ Lockmap Theory 101

A New Standard for a Bitcoin Metaverse. It takes advantage of the nature of data's unique ability to time travel into the future.

## What is Lockmap?

Inspired by [Bitmap](https://gitbook.bitmap.land/) on BTC which is "a consensus standard that allows anybody to claim the geospatial digital real estate of a *[past]* Bitcoin block", Lockmap on BSV allows anybody to claim a *future* Bitcoin block. This process is achieved by being the first to inscribe the text "[blocknumber].lockmap" onto a satoshi using the [1SatOrdinals](https://docs.1satordinals.com/) Inscription standard and in the same transaction lock 1 whole bitcoin until that future block height with [lockup](https://github.com/shruggr/lockup), an [sCrypt](https://scrypt.io/) smart contract. This process is equitable and decentralized, transmuting any Bitcoin block into a part of the metaverse.

Platforms can parse this block data into a 5D realm and grant build access to block owners, creating a new paradigm for open-source development.
Lockmap theory maps Bitcoin's data landscape to metaspatial analogues, bringing to light the base substrate of a persistent metaverse.

## Join the Revolution

We invite you to join us in this exciting journey towards building a truly open metaverse that scales entirely on the L1 base layer of Bitcoin.
